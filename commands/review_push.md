Repeat up to 3 times:

1. **Agent-Review**: Run Cursor’s Agent-Review on the current changes. Fix any issues it reports.
2. **If no errors remain**: Run “git generate commit message”, then commit and push. Stop.
3. **If issues were found**: After fixing, go back to step 1. If this is the 3rd attempt and issues remain, stop and report; do not push.
